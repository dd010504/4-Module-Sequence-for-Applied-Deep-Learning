# 4-Module Sequence for Applied Deep Learning

**By Narges Norouzi** — modeled after the EAAI-2023 Model AI Assignment series :contentReference[oaicite:24]{index=24}

This repository contains a four-part deep learning assignment sequence for undergraduates in CS or engineering, offering hands-on experience with core AI techniques through diverse datasets.

## Modules

| Module | Focus | Dataset |
|--------|-------|---------|
| 1 | Linear Regression, Kernel Methods, Regularization | Facebook Metrics |
| 2 | Preprocessing, Dimensionality Reduction, Logistic Regression, Neural Networks | Fashion-MNIST |
| 3 | CNN Design & Training, Transfer Learning | CIFAR-10 |
| 4 | RNN Classification, LSTM/GRU Analysis | Reuters Newswire |

## Highlights
- **Modular & adaptable** — instructors can cherry-pick modules based on course goals.
- **Skills built**:
  - Implement core ML constructs from scratch
  - Understand overfitting, regularization, and generalization
  - Apply deep learning frameworks effectively
  - Analyze model behavior and performance

## Audience & Prerequisites
Ideal for undergraduate AI/ML courses. Prerequisites: programming basics, data structures, algorithms, probability.

## How to Use
- Navigate to each module’s notebook or handout.
- Follow step-by-step instructions to implement and analyze models.
- Extensions are encouraged—adapt datasets, alter architecture, or experiment with hyperparameters.
